# Connected component labeling with Raspberry Pi using OpenCV and C++ (Count objects)

Connected-component labeling is used in computer vision to detect connected regions in binary digital images, although color images and data with higher dimensionality can also be processed. When integrated into an image recognition system or human-computer interaction interface, connected component labeling can operate on a variety of information. Blob extraction is generally performed on the resulting binary image from a thresholding step. Blobs may be counted, filtered, and tracked.

The algorithm has been tested in a Raspberry Pi 2 using the Camera Module. https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/
